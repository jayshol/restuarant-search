# The Restaurant Search

This web application helps in searching for nearby restaurants given a zipcode for searching. The users can also refine the search based on 

1. Restaurants that are open at the time of search

2. Based on their preferred cuisine

3. Vegetarian friendly options

4. Vegan friendly options

5. Distance from the user's location

It lists out all the restaurants in and around that area and displays their locations with markers in a google map. Clicking on any of those markers provides the info of that particular restaurant like phone number and website url or google page url.
